I am a cool dude, that's for damn sure. I’m a first-year philosophy
undergraduate at LSE, having previously spent a year studying physics at
Imperial—before realizing it wasn’t the cosmic odyssey Brian Cox
documentaries had promised. I grew up near Brighton, in the village of
Rottingdean, and went from a Church of England primary school (St Margaret’s) to
a slightly dodgy Newhaven secondary (Seahaven), before landing at BHASVIC.
There, I took Maths, Further Maths, Physics, and Classics and wrote a ponderous
EPQ on the computability of consciousness. During my gap year, I worked as a
Kitchen Porter to fund travels in Asia and read quite a bit. Then came my stint
at Imperial, which—despite my suspicions about physics—will always be hugely
important to me. Now, I’m at LSE, studying the garrulously titled Philosophy,
Logic, and Scientific Method course. I have no concrete goals beyond a likely
persuit of a masters in Philosophy before maybe, just maybe, working in the civil
service and leading a life vaguely reminiscent of Rory Stewart's.

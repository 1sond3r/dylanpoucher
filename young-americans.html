<p>
Bowie's transmogrification from mulleted glam alien to soulful funkster in late
1974 was the first real risk since his hard-won celebrity, and the first real
experiment. This was an era of British artists flirting with African-American
influences, usually to disastrous effect. Marc Bolan of T-Rex (fellow glam
progenitor and in '74 the bigger star) had seen his own dalliances torpedo
all of the band's remaining chart potential. Their ridiculously titled <i>Zinc
Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow</i> album is an entertaining if baffling
soul reinterpretation of Bolan's boogie-glam formula. Self-produced,
self-indulgent and self-destructive, Marc named his new pioneering style
"Interstellar Supersoul" - which apparently consisted of especially maniacal
songwriting, and shadowing each syncopated stab of guitar with a veritable
orchestra. His wife Gloria Jones, who recorded the original <i>Tainted Love</i>, is
about the only American on the record. Maybe interstellar supersoul sees no
borders, but it would appear the public disagreed. Bolan bombed like all such
dilettantes of the period: Elton John, George Harrison, the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
Bowie in contrast, and almost uniquely, went all in: the look, the songs, the
band, everything. The change in look was sudden: Lurid overalls and
anti-establishment hairdo overnight switched to polyester suits and slick
side-parted coiffure. The musical change was more gradual. Already with '73's
<i>Aladdin Sane</i> character, who conveniently looked exactly like Ziggy, Americana
was seeping in. The album was jazzier, bluesier and doo-wopier than its
self-consciously English predecessor. For now, these were genres British artists
had been trading in for years, and was buying into the <i>New York Dolls</i>, <i>Lou Reed</i>
form of glam more than daring genre mixing.
</p>

<p>
While the following <i>Diamond Dogs</i> album has definite soul influences in the form
of shaft-style wah, electric pianos, and crooning vocals - it too remained
fundamentally a glam project. Its has striking similarities to <i>Zinc Alloy</i>: newly
self-produced, certainly self-indulgent, Bowie risked dabbling. Like Bolan's
effort, I have a misguided appreciation for how schizophrenic it is, but it's
obvious why sales-wise it was a step down from the more focused <i>Aladdin Sane</i>.
Funky cuts like <i>1984</i> feel questionable in a Bolan kind of way, and
correspondingly sank commercially. Contrastingly, the elements which retained an
unalloyed glam feel, like the immortal centrepiece, <i>Rebel Rebel</i>, were big hits.
</p>

<p>
Bowie's nerve held, however. Ziggy may have "Gone to America" in '73, but it
wasn't until late '74 David Jones truly followed. The full move only really took
place during the <i>Diamond Dogs</i> tour. The first leg in July already had the new
look, and the songs had a new plastic sheen over them, though they were still
played by the original Diamond Dogs band. Quite a band, with names like Herbie
Flowers on Bass and Earl Slick on guitar, but hardly genre authentic.
</p>

<p>
During a one month break in August, during which began recording of 1975's <i>Young
Americans</i> in Philadelphia, the metamorphosis continued and much of the band was
replaced with dyed-in-the-wool soul musicians. Carlos Alomar was now on guitar,
coming from the Apollo Theatre house band. The gospel-tinged backing vocals,
which became gradually more prominent during the tour (the number of singers
ultimately tripling), were arranged by a painfully young Luther Vandross - who,
much later, went on to have hit duets with Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. Songs
to be on <i>Young Americans</i> were folded into the set, purpose-designed for the new
soul image, as opposed to the awkwardly funked-up adaptations of previous hits.
</p>

<p>
The shows themselves, for a time, continued to be a theatrical bonanza
characteristic of glam excess - including giant hands bespectacled with
light-bulbs and temperamental motorised bridges (Bowie tended to get stuck over
the audience while singing Moonage Daydream). By October however, the chrysalis
had completely burst open: the elaborate staging was scrapped, the band
finalised (Dennis Davis now on drums) and the tour re-branded as "The Soul Tour."
This new "Soul Man" persona was the true first in, and set the archetype for, a
career defined by image makeovers.
</p>

<p>
While nowadays I think most people look back on this particular transition as
positive in the long run, if only for incubating the critically adored <i>Station
to Station</i> from 1976. Its fair to say that musically, the first result of <i>Young
Americans</i> remains slightly more divisive. For me on the other hand, despite its
admittedly patchy track listing and preponderance of sax, <i>Young Americans</i> may
just be my most played Bowie record. While its quality as an album is easily
surpassed, there are tons of elements and individual tracks which feel
incredibly unique, and subsequently unexplored by almost anybody. You can find a
million Ziggy-worshipping bands of the post-punk school in the late 70s/early
80s, but I can't think of anything else quite like this.
</p>

<p>
The title track immediately introduces the sleek, mid-tempo groove that
permeates much of the album. The vocals the breathy, strained and oh-so-
plastic, but combined with those fantastic backing singers the effect becomes
something quite inimitable. 'Win' slows it down, verses lapping like water on a
lake before the great swell of the chorus: brilliant. 'Fascination' is a funky
clavinet based torrent (we like our pained water metaphors) which is just
made by those backing vocalists. The following track 'Right' is probably my
favourite on the album and feels like a sister to fascination: it brings back
some atmosphere through a persistent tension which is never quite released.
</p>

<p>
The album admittedly is objectively boring or terrible at times, "Across the
Universe" is a low point and is yet more proof Bowie's strong point is not
covers. "Somebody Up There Likes Me" feels forced and "Can You Hear Me" is a bit
of a dud (the ending is cool though). They both fall into the trap all soul
risks: Feeling a bit overproduced and saccharine: lacking distinctiveness. I
think these solecisms are made up for by "Fame" which was the American hit. More
Lennon influence on this one: he contributed guitar, backing vocals, and helped
with the writing (by apparently reversing a middle-8 by Stevie Wonder). Its the
opposite of nondescript, and probably the funkiest track on the record. Driven
by a great big fat distorted guitar lick, it seems to prefigure some of the
darker elements of the following, much less commercial, Station to Station.
</p>

<p>
That figure we both respect and tut-tut for his endless quest for the hip, and I
mean <i>hip</i> in the most grandiloquent sense, was fully born not in Brixton but
Philadelphia; the product of his successful re-baptism into the church of
blue-eyed - or, to put it with suitable pretension, heterochromatic-eyed soul.
The congregation accepted him with open arms and platinum sales. While his peers
were falling by the wayside, <i>Young Americans</i> spawned his first US No. 1, secured
him as one of the first white artists featured on Soul Train, and stood as his
best-selling album to date. It was this first forbidden sip of true
superstardom, complete with surreal televised Cher duet, which would give him
the confidence for his most experimental highs (Low, Earthling) and neuroticism
for his most simpering lows (Tonight, Never Let Me Down).
</p>

<p>
All that is to say, its an important album and slightly overlooked. Without
context, it seems to lack the aesthetic daring of his more ostentatious periods,
but there are loads of elements and individual tracks here which feel incredibly
unique and subsequently unexplored by almost anybody. You can find a million
Ziggy-worshipping bands of the post-punk school in the late 70s/early 80s, but I
can't think of anything quite like Bowie's approach to soul. I think it's just
great!

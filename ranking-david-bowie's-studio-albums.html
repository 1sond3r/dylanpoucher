<h1 class="title">Ranking David Bowie's Studio Albums
<br />
<span class="subtitle">The official ranking</span>
</h1>
<p>
I have listened to David Bowie a lot. His best music draws me towards it more
than almost anything else which claims to be art. Is this because of or in spite
of its actual artistic merit? It is hard to tell. David Bowie, at his core, was
a deeply pretentious man. Clearly intelligent, and certainly with a genius for
<i>something</i> dare I say valuable: but was it art? Was he a cultural parasite or
visionary, and is there any difference? I am generally of the belief that it is
literally impossible to separate whatever art is from its context. It would seem
to me that an artist's job is to assemble the best they can the motifs of their
culture into greater superstructures for the next generation to do the same. Pop
music doesn't seem to be that, at least, in order to be popular. It is instead
defined by cultural <i>reflection</i>.
</p>

<p>
Other mediums, a style may arise from a particular idea espoused by a certain
artist represented in a certain painting. Pop isn't like that, its like
Tolstoy's overwrought theory of battle: continuous and chaotic. We should be as
suspicious of a great man theory of pop as a great man theory of history.
Moments change history, not people.
</p>

<p>
That being said, we still recognise Napoleon as somebody pretty special. Beyond
somebody just at the right place at the right time. If he could only embody the
unimpeachable forces of his age, he did a good job at it. I think we have to
think of David Bowie in a similar way. If he had an art it was the art of
survival in a game where you have to make good fucking music. And, I think for
a longer period than almost anyone else, he did. Its the techniques somebody
uses in order to do that which creates timeless songs. Maybe its the clearest
reflections of popular culture, such that they become indistinguishable from the
moment they reflect, that constitute true pop art. Either way, I fucking like it.
</p>

<p>
. So is David
Bowie an artist: Maybe.
</p>

<p>
Look, I like me some
</p>

<p>
I don't see
art existing independently from context

Really shit. Slightly embarrassing that he considered this an improvement upon
his 80s work. "The Wedding" is so dated and terrible sounding I almost can't
believe it.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Can't remember much of it, poor singing and songwriting seems to be my main
recollection. I think I sort of liked "What's Really Happening." Almost the
opposite of its predecessor: lacking energy, distinguishing features and <i>meaning</i>
both in and of itself and in Bowie's career as a whole. A huge step down and
disappointing blip in the Bowie narrative of steady improvement from the 90s
onwards.

<p>
Really crap. "Day in Day Out" is one of the most ludicrous songs ever made.
"Time Will Crawl" is the only song with any redeeming qualities. The fact that
it is so 80s, and represents a musician at his most insecure at least gives it
appeal as a historical artefact.

Some fine covers, mostly forgettable. Anodyne. Universally considered a bizarre
release in the midst of his first golden period.

<p>
A significant improvement upon Black Tie White Noise of the same year. Nothing
incredible, and the production is equally dated, but the songwriting is better.
A bit of a Britpoppy feel, especially with that Gallagher-style vocal bit in the
title track, you know what I'm talking about.

<p>
Slightly over-hated, it's fine. Although beginning the descent into self-parody
("Loving the Alien") he still has a proper song or two to offer. "Blue Jean" is
great. The covers are awful. I get the sense it was not the hit he wanted, but
still sold strongly.

<p>
I find myself defending this one. Weird in an interesting way I think. Certainly
mercifully short. I never listen to it though. A lot of the instincts which
produce the charm of this record pop up throughout his career with decreasing
charm.

This is when these albums start to get kind of good! A big seller too, "Slow

predecessor.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The comeback after a decade, I like it. A self-conscious extension of his
"Heroes" sound (look at the cover). Nothing super standout apart from maybe
"Where Are We Now" which was also the first single. Simple but moving, not too
edgy which I wish was true of more of the album.

<p>
Surprisingly good considering the dreadful cover art. He's in good voice here
too: listen to "New Killer Star." A backwards-looking album I would say, lots of
Modern Lovers influence with the sloppy guitars (and cover of "Pablo Picasso").
"Bring Me the Disco King" is an effective closer and would end up being his last
song for 10 years after having a heart attack during the associated promo tour
for the album.

<p>
I used to really like this one for some reason. Again, has good ideas, but may
actually be a step back from 1969. Feels a bit more dated somehow with the
"Black Country" sound. Some great tracks though. "All the Madmen" and the title
track especially. Nothing to touch the highs of the previous record however.

<p>
Lots of songs go on too long, but most of them have really great moments or
interesting ideas. "Space Oddity" is a triumph, the ending of "Cygnet Committee"
is fantastic. "Memory of a Free Festival" feels like a classic hippie chant but
apparently wasn't. I don't know, I like it.

A grower. Initially nondescript but actually has some very nice pop writing.
"DJ" is amazing, "Fantastic Voyage," "Boys Keep Swinging," the same. Okay?! Some

<p>
Like it: his true artistic comeback after the 80s. Trying too hard maybe but at
least the results are interesting. Probably too long, but I actually enjoy the
segues and concept even if it in a postmodern, condescending kind of way. How
innocent we were in 1995. The sound he goes for is certainly pushing it for a
48-year-old man, but he just about pulls it off. For the most part, good to
great songs: the highlight being a rerecording of a track of a Buddha of
Suburbia track actually: "Strangers When We Meet." Its main draw is as an entire
album though.

First side is fantastic, really, really good and makes you wonder what the 80s
could have been. You've got your pop and your experimentation nicely mixed
unlike the bipolar regimentation of Low and "Heroes." The second side for me has
always been a strange flop. "Teenage Wildlife" just never hit. All the elements
are there but they just don't come together. The same for the rest of the songs.

Love it, love it, love it. Indulgent but incredibly listenable pop music.
Fantastic production, making even the fluff "Ricochet," etc. really quite
pleasurable. Even "China Girl," with its questionable Osterberg lyrics, makes
the unexpected transmogrification into transcendent pop song complete with
addictive riff! True magic. The centrepiece, giving the album its name, was a
hit of such scale that it led Bowie to quixotically chase popular adulation for
the next decade or so.

Some absolute resounding classics on here which would have etched Bowie's name

little bit. So much good material though, even if the overall album experience
feels a bit lacking. Glam has nearly taken over here but some of his folksier

Song for song, not much to fault it for really. Lacks a certain grandiosity and

though. In a Bowie album of this period I want a ridiculous concept goddammit!
That being said there's certainly a lot of good noise on here, and I would
regard this as his "heaviest" album in terms of cranking the amps up. Lots of

</p>



<p>
Bowie's transmogrification from mulleted glam alien to soulful funkster in late
1974 was the first real risk since his hard-won celebrity, and the first real
experiment. This was an era of British artists flirting with African-American
influences, usually to disastrous effect. The most illuminating example is Marc
Bolan of T-Rex - fellow glam progenitor and, in '74, still just about the bigger
star - Bolan attempted his own dalliances with the ridiculously named <i>Zinc Alloy
and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow</i>. Self-produced, self-indulgent and
self-destructive, his pioneering new "Interstellar Supersoul," torpedoed all of
the band's remaining chart potential. The genre seemed to consist of comically
maniacal songwriting, and layering each syncopated stab of guitar with a
veritable orchestra. His wife Gloria Jones, who recorded the original <i>Tainted
Love</i>, was about the only American musician on the record. Maybe such cosmic
music sees no borders - and I have my own soft-spot for the album - but the
record shows that Bolan bombed like all other British dilettantes of the period: Elton
John, George Harrison, the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
Bowie in contrast, and to my mind uniquely, went native: the look, the songs,
the band, everything. The change in look was sudden: Lurid overalls and
anti-establishment hairdo were replaced overnight with polyester suits and slick
side-parted coiffure. The musical change was more gradual. Already with '73's
<i>Aladdin Sane</i> character, who conveniently looked exactly like Ziggy, Americana
was seeping in. The album was jazzier, bluesier and doo-wopier than its
self-consciously English predecessor. For now though, these were genres British
artists had been trading in for years, and was buying into the <i>New York Dolls</i>,
<i>Lou Reed</i> form of glam more than daring genre mixing.
</p>

<p>
The following <i>Diamond Dogs</i> album was the first to have definite soul influences.
But even with the shaft-style wah, electric pianos, and crooning vocals - it too
remained fundamentally a glam project. Its has striking similarities to <i>Zinc
Alloy</i>: newly self-produced, certainly self-indulgent, Bowie risked dabbling.
Like Bolan's effort, I have a misguided appreciation for how schizophrenic it
is, but it's obvious why sales-wise it was a step down from the more focused
<i>Aladdin Sane</i>. Funky cuts like <i>1984</i> are Bolan-esque in their clumsiness, and
correspondingly sank commercially. Contrastingly, the elements which retained an
unalloyed glam feel, like the immortal centrepiece, <i>Rebel Rebel</i>, were big hits.
</p>

<p>
Bowie's nerve held, however. Ziggy may have "Gone to America" in '73, but it
wasn't until late '74 David Jones truly followed. The full move only really took
place during the <i>Diamond Dogs</i> tour. The first leg in July already had the new
look, and the songs had a new plastic sheen over them, though they were still
played by the original Diamond Dogs band. Quite a band, with names like Herbie
Flowers on Bass and Earl Slick on guitar, but hardly genre authentic.
</p>

<p>
During a one month break in August, during which began recording of 1975's <i>Young
Americans</i> in Philadelphia, the metamorphosis continued and much of the band was
replaced with dyed-in-the-wool soul musicians. Carlos Alomar was now on guitar,
coming from the Apollo Theatre house band. The gospel-tinged backing vocals,
which became gradually more prominent during the tour (the number of singers
ultimately tripling), were arranged by a painfully young Luther Vandross - who,
much later, went on to have hit duets with Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. Songs
to be on <i>Young Americans</i> were folded into the set, purpose-designed for the new
soul image, as opposed to the awkwardly funked-up adaptations of previous hits.
</p>

<p>
The shows themselves, for a time, continued to be a theatrical bonanza
characteristic of glam excess - including giant hands bespectacled with
light-bulbs and temperamental motorised bridges (Bowie tended to get stuck over
the audience while singing Moonage Daydream). By October however, the chrysalis
had completely burst open: the elaborate staging was scrapped, the band
finalised (Dennis Davis now on drums) and the tour re-branded as "The Soul Tour."
This new "Soul Man" persona was the true first in, and set the archetype for, a
career defined by image makeovers.
</p>

<p>
While nowadays I think most people look back on this particular transition as
positive in the long run, if only for incubating the critically adored <i>Station
to Station</i> from 1976. Its fair to say that musically, the first result of <i>Young
Americans</i> remains slightly more divisive. For me on the other hand, despite its
admittedly patchy track listing and preponderance of sax, <i>Young Americans</i> may
just be my most played Bowie record. While its quality as an album is easily
surpassed, there are tons of elements and individual tracks which feel
incredibly unique, and subsequently unexplored by almost anybody. You can find a
million Ziggy-worshipping bands of the post-punk school in the late 70s/early
80s, but I can't think of anything else quite like this.
</p>

<p>
The title track immediately introduces the sleek, mid-tempo groove that
permeates much of the album. The vocals the breathy, strained and oh-so-
plastic, but combined with those fantastic backing singers the effect becomes
something quite inimitable. 'Win' slows it down, verses lapping like water on a
lake before the great swell of the chorus: brilliant. 'Fascination' is a funky
clavinet based torrent (we like our pained water metaphors) which is just
made by those backing vocalists. The following track 'Right' is probably my
favourite on the album and feels like a sister to fascination: it brings back
some atmosphere through a persistent tension which is never quite released.
</p>

<p>
The album admittedly is objectively boring or terrible at times, "Across the
Universe" is a low point and is yet more proof Bowie's strong point is not
covers. "Somebody Up There Likes Me" feels forced and "Can You Hear Me" is a bit
of a dud (the ending is cool though). They both fall into the trap all soul
risks: Feeling a bit overproduced and saccharine: lacking distinctiveness. I
think these solecisms are made up for by "Fame" which was the American hit. More
Lennon influence on this one: he contributed guitar, backing vocals, and helped
with the writing (by apparently reversing a middle-8 by Stevie Wonder). Its the
opposite of nondescript, and probably the funkiest track on the record. Driven
by a great big fat distorted guitar lick, it seems to prefigure some of the
darker elements of the following, much less commercial, Station to Station.
</p>

<p>
That figure we both respect and tut-tut for his endless quest for the hip, and I
mean <i>hip</i> in the most grandiloquent sense, was fully born not in Brixton but
Philadelphia; the product of his successful re-baptism into the church of
blue-eyed - or, to put it with suitable pretension, heterochromatic-eyed soul.
The congregation accepted him with open arms and platinum sales. While his peers
were falling by the wayside, <i>Young Americans</i> spawned his first US No. 1, secured
him as one of the first white artists featured on Soul Train, and stood as his
best-selling album to date. It was this first forbidden sip of true
superstardom, complete with surreal televised Cher duet, which would give him
the confidence for his most experimental highs (Low, Earthling) and neuroticism
for his most simpering lows (Tonight, Never Let Me Down).
</p>

<p>
All that is to say, its an important album and slightly overlooked. Without
context, it seems to lack the aesthetic daring of his more ostentatious periods,
but there are loads of elements and individual tracks here which feel incredibly
unique and subsequently unexplored by almost anybody. You can find a million
Ziggy-worshipping bands of the post-punk school in the late 70s/early 80s, but I
can't think of anything quite like Bowie's approach to soul. I think it's just
great!
</p>



<p>
Well what for the music itself?
</p>

<p>
All that is to say,
it's an important period!
</p>





<p>
It is this kind of immersion which stops
the record from feeling like the mere dilettantism seen in Harrison, Bolan or
countless others in the '74-'75 period. Despite never being sonically ahead of
the curve, Bowie's striking depth of commitment creates the irresistible
illusion of a visionary - which, in the pop world, is about as good as it gets.
</p>


<p>
"The Soul Man"
was the true first in, and set the archetype for, a career of image makeovers.
</p>














<p>
Its a little bit strange looking back at the TV appearances from
theis period, Bowie is treated sort of like a pretty uncool yacht rocker or
something. Duets with Cher, opening the Grammys, comedically demonstrating
self-defence techniques all feel very disjunctive from where Bowie had been or
was going. It almost feels like a mini "Let's Dance" period.
</p>


<p>
As for the
music, I would tentatively place <i>Young Americans</i> among the triumphs of his
discography.
</p>



<p>
Technicolor overalls changed to polyester suits
</p>



<p>
must given mister Jones the confidence throughout the rest of his career
to continue chasing that
</p>


<p>
Musically, there
had been warning signs: Ziggy had already gone to America with Aladdin
Sane
</p>

<p>
and the kalideoscopic Diamond Dogs
</p>

<p>
The final change occurred with remarkable spontaneity during the especially
debauched later legs of the 1974 tour. Technicolor overalls changed to polyester
suits sequined with lies which sparkled brighter than the truth.
</p>

<p>
Bowie's <i>Young
Americans</i> from 1975 marks the a new haircut, and necessarily
a new genre to go along with it.
</p>


<p>
and a switch
from technicolor overalls to polyester suits; sequined with lies which sparkled
brighter than the truth.
</p>


<p>
"<i>Ziggy goes to America</i>" was the first in a long line of
performative flaunts done to cement a reputation as a cultural Proteus,
</p>

<p>
and its success was vital for his
subsequent 40 year career of aesthetic vitality.
</p>



<p>
A guilty pleasure. Flawed, yes, with its patchy track listing and preponderance
of sax, but without question my most streamed Bowie LP. Aptly named, <i>Young
Americans</i> marks Bowie's turn from the slightly passé British glam to the more
aesthetically vital Philadelphia soul. The stakes were high: Marc Bolan of T-Rex
(fellow glam progenitor and in '74 the bigger star) had seen his own flirtations
with Americana torpedo all of his remaining chart potential. In retrospect,
however, the commercial failure of the garrulously titled and critically slated
"<i>Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow</i>" was guaranteed by Bolan's
declining songwriting abilities in <i>any</i> genre not from popular incredulity
toward British rockers getting funky. Bowie's effort, in contrast, spawned his
first US No. 1, secured him as one of the first white artists featured on Soul
Train, and stood as his best-selling album to date.`
</p>

<p>
While it turned out the public's musical metaphysics ended at the dance floor,
the more scholastic critics found the transition troubling. The so-called "<i>Ziggy
goes to America</i>" pivot was the first in a long line of performative flaunts done
to cement a reputation as a cultural Proteus. Going soul then would be the
equivalent of making a rap album today — decades later, Mr. David Jones would in
fact veer in that unfortunate direction. But here, he gets it right. It stands
as one of his most successful and peerless transitions. You can find a million
Ziggy-worshipping bands of the post-punk school in the late 70s / early 80s, and
even echoes of the sleazy art-funk that Bowie would develop by 1976, but I can
personally think of nothing else quite like Bowie's heterochromatic-eyed, soul.
</p>

<p>
The success of a major genre switch seems to depend on two things: especially
robust songs, and the authority of an authentic band. While Bowie's propensity
for the former ebbed and flowed, he nearly always retained a remarkable
curatorial instinct - and nerve - to surround himself with genuinely fresh
talent. The musical opposite to my mind is George Harrison: he made some
terrific albums in the early 70s when his influences were vital, but the
ossification of his unchanging circle led to increasing stylistic
stultification. His own unsuccessful forays into soul with <i>Extra Texture</i> were
done with the same tired old guard of English musicians he had been using
since 1970. I think Bowie lived his life in neurotic fear of that possibility.
</p>

<p>
For <i>Young Americans</i> Carlos Alomar is on guitar, coming from the Apollo Theatre
house band (of <i>James Brown, Live at The Apollo</i> fame), bringing deep RnB chops. A
member of Sly (Andy Newmark) is on drums. The gospel-tinged backing vocals,
which completely elevate the album, were arranged by Luther Vandross of all
people. (Who, much later, went on to have hit duets with Janet Jackson and
Mariah Carey.) It is this kind of immersion which stops the record from feeling
like the mere dilettantism seen in Harrison, Bolan or countless others in the
'74-'75 period. Despite never being sonically ahead of the curve, Bowie's
striking depth of commitment creates the irresistible illusion of a visionary -
which, in the pop world, is about as good as it gets.

John Lennon is on it too just for fun.

Some have called this the "Young Americans" of the 90s in terms of Bowie
meddling in genres he probably shouldn't: this time Drum and Bass and Jungle. I
know I shouldn't really place it this high, but I just can't stop listening to
it! Much, much better production than anything else of his from around this
period, and the energy is infectious. Also am I crazy or is the songwriting the
best it has been in years? "Little Wonder" <i>is</i> a wonder! "Looking for Satellites"
builds gloriously, "Battle for Britain (The Letter)" is highly memorable. The album is just festooned with hooks! The
only real weak point for me is the last track, "Law (Eathlings On Fire)" which
is a bit of a tuneless, cringeworthy mess. It is precisely the inclusion of such
a song though which reminds us how bad this album could have been, and so I
welcome it.
</p>

<p>
This album was also the first, and maybe last time, since 1983 that Bowie
released an album truly in keeping with the mood of the day. It is highly "Brit"
influenced, released in the year of peak Cool Britannia, 1997. Blair had just
been elected, "Candle in the Wind" had become the best selling British single
and "Be Here Now" the fastest selling British Album. It, as with all movements,
would promptly blow up - but Bowie got there just in time. I think if this were
released in 1998 I would look on it much less favourably. Where "Outside" feels
highly American and grungy in that self-serious, and by 1995 slightly dated way,
Earthling is light and fun. The contrast between the album covers really does
sum everything up, union jack jacket and all.

I acknowledge another guilty pleasure
okay! I can see its faults in the Shaft-style wah-wah of "1984" but quite
frankly I think you need to stop "wah-wah"-ing yourself and man up.
</p>


<p>
The medley
is cool as hell, the title track is family singalong material, "We Are the Dead"
has atmosphere in spades and is one of the few instances where the album
actually links back to the whole "1984" concept. Its exactly the rarefied
quality of Bowie's greatest concept albums that justify their very concept. This
is what Outside got wrong, and every other concept album: greatness occurs in
the space between perception and reality. Of course Bowie couldn't write a good
post-apocalyptic story, as he proves again and again, but we still all want to
believe he could. Let us fill in the gaps, thank you. I think the greatest
artists, or pop artists at least, are those able to understand culture enough to
play enough tricks of the light to deceive us there is actually something
profound out there. It is precisely the weakness of the concept that makes it
feel natural and <i>cool</i> unlike some Tommy Pink Floyd Rush bullshit. "Rock 'n Roll
with me" and "Big Brother" are stupid with their unjustified bombast and
comparatively weak hooks. They're all the better for it. This is a decadent
masterpiece made when Bowie's cool was at high enough levels to envelop and
justify any act of hubris imaginable.

Some of his greatest singing and by far his most consistent record. Adding some
edge to that blue-eyed-soul makes it much more critically palatable, it seems.
The band is on fire here and live material from around this period was probably
his best too. The classic 10 minute opening, and title, track would act as an
opportunity for the band to show off in live performances. Bowie was typically
late to funk, the minister himself, James Brown, had run out of steam two years
prior, but the groove is instrumental for justifying the longer lengths of the
songs - there are only 6 here. His soulful singing has become much more refined
since the last record and uses his voice to tremendous effect, I love the low
crooner qualities of "Wild is the Wind" and "Word on a Wing." The nasty riff of
"Stay" has more music in it than most Band's entire discographies. "Golden
Years" memorable vocal bits, funky guitar and overall structure are amazing.
Structure is the main word for this album, the songs all have an intriguing
structure, and you can never really tell where they are going to go next: not a
note is out of place or without purpose. It makes me depressed knowing that
music like this will never be released again. I don't care if I sound like a
miserable cunt: I think my review of the next album will make that clear.

I hate to be conventional here but let's be honest, it is his best album. Easily
his most significant with the greatest examples of his songwriting: "Five
Years", "Soul Love", "Moonage Daydream", "Lady Stardust", "Ziggy Stardust",
"Suffergete City", "Rock 'n Roll Suicide" and of course the omnipresent and
therefore semi-insufferable "Starman" are pretty much unimpeachable. The
aesthetic, sentiment and vision of this album are such departures from the
mission statement of Elvis' "Heartbreak Hotel" that, looking back, its almost
unbelievable they were released a mere 16 little years apart. This was released
<i>8 years</i> after the Beatles went on Ed Sullivan, and a mere <i>5 years</i> before rock
exploded in the Punk revolution. This was a period when music mattered, it truly
reflected and influenced culture, and its development occurred at a breakneck
speed. 8 years ago (as of writing) was 2017. Charli had already gone Hyperpop,
Kendrick had already released Damn, the biggest pop stars then are the biggest
pop stars now. I'm not saying things haven't moved on but I cannot help thinking
there will be a lot more discussion (musically) in 100 years time about the
years 1964 - 1972 then 2017 - 2025. Already after 1972, signs of stagnation and
doubt would begin to set in. Bowie would go soul, Wings would become huge,
Johnny Rotten would pretend to tear it all down (for the second time).

This was the high watermark of the youth project, and all attempts since to
recapture that time ignore the facts. You can see all of the bullshit, good and
bad, expected of any modern popular figure reflected in this album, and in
Bowie's career a as a whole. It is perhaps not the most consistent, but
nonetheless it represents the zenith of youth culture. Bowie has been there and
done it, and it will never happen again. You can only parody the very concept of
popular superstardom once, a parody of a parody isn't clever, it's increasingly
lazy and pathetic and we are now at the seventh generation of parody. Just be
happy it happened.

I have listened to David Bowie a non inconsiderable amount.
* 26: Black Tie White Noise (1993)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1993-Black-Tie-White-Noise-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Really shit. Slightly embarrassing that he considered this an improvement upon
his 80s work. "The Wedding" is so dated and terrible sounding I almost can't
believe it.

* 25: 'Hours...' (1999)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1999-Hours-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Can't remember much of it, poor singing and songwriting seems to be my main
recollection. I think I sort of liked "What's Really Happening." Almost the
opposite of its predecessor: lacking energy, distinguishing features and /meaning/
both in and of itself and in Bowie's career as a whole. A huge step down and
disappointing blip in the Bowie narrative of steady improvement from the 90s
onwards.

* 24: Never Let Me Down (1987)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1987-Never-Let-Me-Down-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Really crap. "Day in Day Out" is one of the most ludicrous songs ever made.
"Time Will Crawl" is the only song with any redeeming qualities. The fact that
it is /so/ 80s, and represents a musician at his most insecure at least gives it
appeal as a historical artefact.

* 23: Pin Ups (1973)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1973_Pin_Ups_David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Some fine covers, mostly forgettable. Anodyne. Universally considered a bizarre
release in the midst of his first golden period.

* 22: The Buddha of Suburbia (1993)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1993-The-Buddha-of-Suburbia-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

A significant improvement upon Black Tie White Noise of the same year. Nothing
incredible, and the production is equally dated, but the songwriting is better.
A bit of a Britpoppy feel, especially with that Gallagher-style vocal bit in the
title track, you know what I'm talking about.

* 21: Tonight (1984)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1984-Tonight-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Slightly over-hated, it's fine. Although beginning the descent into self-parody
("Loving the Alien") he still has a proper song or two to offer. "Blue Jean" is
great. The covers are awful. I get the sense it was not the hit he wanted, but
still sold strongly.

* 20: David Bowie (1967)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://matthasanopinion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/david-bowie-debut.jpg?w=758]]

I find myself defending this one. Weird in an interesting way I think. Certainly
mercifully short. I never listen to it though. A lot of the instincts which
produce the charm of this record pop up throughout his career with decreasing
charm.

* 19: Heathen (2002)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/2002-Heathen-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

This is when these albums start to get kind of good! A big seller too, "Slow
Burn" is great. Not much more to say. A thankful improvement upon its
predecessor.

* 18: The Next Day (2013)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/2013-The-Next-Day-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

The comeback after a decade, I like it. A self-conscious extension of his
"Heroes" sound (look at the cover). Nothing super standout apart from maybe
"Where Are We Now" which was also the first single. Simple but moving, not too
edgy which I wish was true of more of the album.

* 17: Reality (2003)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/2003-Reality-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Surprisingly good considering the dreadful cover art. He's in good voice here
too: listen to "New Killer Star." A backwards-looking album I would say, lots of
Modern Lovers influence with the sloppy guitars (and cover of "Pablo Picasso").
"Bring Me the Disco King" is an effective closer and would end up being his last
song for 10 years after having a heart attack during the associated promo tour
for the album.

* 16: The Man Who Sold the World (1970)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1970-The-Man-Who-Sold-the-World-david-bowie-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

I used to really like this one for some reason. Again, has good ideas, but may
actually be a step back from 1969. Feels a bit more dated somehow with the
"Black Country" sound. Some great tracks though. "All the Madmen" and the title
track especially. Nothing to touch the highs of the previous record however.

* 15: David Bowie (1969)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1969-david-bowie-david-bowie-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Lots of songs go on too long, but most of them have really great moments or
interesting ideas. "Space Oddity" is a triumph, the ending of "Cygnet Committee"
is fantastic. "Memory of a Free Festival" feels like a classic hippie chant but
apparently wasn't. I don't know, I like it.

* 14: Lodger (1979)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1979-Lodger-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

A grower. Initially nondescript but actually has some very nice pop writing.
"DJ" is amazing, "Fantastic Voyage," "Boys Keep Swinging," the same. Okay?! Some
dirge, but certainly nothing offensive.

* 13: Outside (1995)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1995-Outside-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Like it: his true artistic comeback after the 80s. Trying too hard maybe but at
least the results are interesting. Probably too long, but I actually enjoy the
segues and concept even if it in a postmodern, condescending kind of way. How
innocent we were in 1995. The sound he goes for is certainly pushing it for a
48-year-old man, but he just about pulls it off. For the most part, good to
great songs: the highlight being a rerecording of a track of a Buddha of
Suburbia track actually: "Strangers When We Meet." Its main draw is as an entire
album though.

* 12: Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1980-Scary-Monsters-And-Super-Creeps-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

First side is fantastic, really, really good and makes you wonder what the 80s
could have been. You've got your pop and your experimentation nicely mixed
unlike the bipolar regimentation of Low and "Heroes." The second side for me has
always been a strange flop. "Teenage Wildlife" just never hit. All the elements
are there but they just don't come together. The same for the rest of the songs.

* 11: Let's Dance (1983)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1983-Lets-Dance-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Love it, love it, love it. Indulgent but incredibly listenable pop music.
Fantastic production, making even the fluff "Ricochet," etc. really quite
pleasurable. Even "China Girl," with its questionable Osterberg lyrics, makes
the unexpected transmogrification into transcendent pop song complete with
addictive riff! True magic. The centrepiece, giving the album its name, was a
hit of such scale that it led Bowie to quixotically chase popular adulation for
the next decade or so.

* 10: Blackstar (2016)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/david-bowie-blackstar-2016-billboard-1000.jpg]]

Look, I want to like this more than I do. Everyone seems to rate it much higher.
It's great, sure. Consistent, interesting, emotional, etc. He uses his aged
voice well. There isn't really a dud. I don't know, I can do what I want.

* 9: Hunky Dory (1971)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1971-Hunky-Dory-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Some absolute resounding classics on here which would have etched Bowie's name
in the stars regardless of what came after. I cannot help but feel they are
/slightly/ tiresome. Something about "Changes" and "Life on Mars" grate on me a
little bit. So much good material though, even if the overall album experience
feels a bit lacking. Glam has nearly taken over here but some of his folksier
tendencies are still present.

* 8: Aladdin Sane (1973)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://storage.highresaudio.com/library/bild/c_490000/499992/field4.jpg]]

Song for song, not much to fault it for really. Lacks a certain grandiosity and
individuality which albums like Ziggy Stardust and Diamond Dogs have in spades
though. In a Bowie album of this period I want a ridiculous concept goddammit!
That being said there's certainly a lot of good noise on here, and I would
regard this as his "heaviest" album in terms of cranking the amps up. Lots of
fun: rock 'n roll man. Probably the high point of glam.

* 7: "Heroes" (1977)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1977-Heroes-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Low but slightly worse. Amazing how different the sound is overall though
considering they originate from the same year. "Heroes" is perhaps his best song
though, anthemic, etc. The ambient stuff I like more actually. I don't know, it
may actually be better than Low but nostalgia stops me from admitting this.

* 6: Low (1977)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1977-Low-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

We had this in the car and I listened to it a lot. The first half is probably
the best side he ever did. The ambient stuff is sometimes great but let's be
honest it has been far superseded.

* 5: Young Americans (1975)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1975-Young-AmericansDavid-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Guilty pleasure, I can identify its problems but my god I cannot stop listening
to it. Objectively boring and terrible at times, "Across the Universe" is a low
point and is yet more proof Bowie's strong point is not covers. Has greats to
balance out the trash, a great album in terms of singing.

* 4: Earthling (1997)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1997-Earthling-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

To some degree the "Young Americans" of the 90s in terms of Bowie meddling in
genres he probably shouldn't. Enormously guilty pleasure, but I just can't stop
listening. Much, much better production than anything else of his from around
this period, and the energy is infectious. Also am I crazy or is the songwriting
the best it has been in years? "Little Wonder" /is/ a wonder! "Looking for
Satellites" builds gloriously, "Battle for Britain (The Letter)" is highly
memorable.

* 3: Diamond Dogs (1974)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1974-Diamond-DogsDavid-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

This for me is the most David Bowie David Bowie album. Glam, concept, hits,
style, gender trouble, ridiculousness: I acknowledge another guilty pleasure
okay! I can see its faults in the Shaft-style wah-wah of "1984" but quite
frankly I think you need to stop "wah-wah"-ing yourself and man the fuck up.
This is a decadent masterpiece made when Bowie's cultural cool was at high
enough levels to envelop and justify any act of hubris imaginable.


* 2: Station to Station (1976)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1976-Station-to-Station-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

Some of his greatest singing and by far his most consistent record. Adding some
edge to that blue-eyed-soul makes it much more critically palatable, it seems.
Not a note is out of place or without purpose. It makes me depressed knowing
that music like this will never be released again. The riff alone in "Stay" has
more music in it than anything released in the last 20 years. I don't care if I
sound like a miserable cunt.

* 1: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 500px
[[https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/1972-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Ziggy-Stardust-and-the-Spiders-from-Mars-David-Bowie-billboard-1000.jpg?w=1000]]

I hate to be conventional here but let's be honest, it is his best album. Easily
his most significant, with greatest songwriting. Perhaps not the most
consistent, but in many ways this represents to me the zenith of youth culture.
Bowie has been there and done it, and it will never happen again. You can only
parody the very concept of popular superstardom once, a parody of a parody isn't
clever, it's increasingly lazy and pathetic and we are now at the seventh
generation of parody. Just be happy it happened.
